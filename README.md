11. **Sparse Arrays**: There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings.
    - [Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sparse-arrays/problem)
    - [Solution](./sparse-arrays/solution.js)
12. **Array Manipulation**: Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in your array.

### Linked List Problems

1. **Print the Elements of a Linked List**: If you're new to linked lists, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), don’t print anything.
    - [Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/print-the-elements-of-a-linked-list/problem)
    - [Solution](./print-the-elements-of-a-linked-list/solution.js)
2. **Insert a Node at the Tail of a Linked List**: You are given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer. Insert this node at the tail of the linked list and return the head node of the linked list formed after inserting this new node. The given head pointer may be null, meaning that the initial list is empty.
    - [Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-the-tail-of-a-linked-list/problem/problem)
    - [Solution](./insert-a-node-at-the-tail-of-a-linked-list/solution.js)
3. **Insert a node at the head of a linked list**: You’re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the head of the linked list and return the new head node. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.
    - [Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-the-head-of-a-linked-list/problem)
    - [Solution](./insert-a-node-at-the-head-of-a-linked-list/solution.js)
4. **Insert a node at a specific position in a linked list**: You’re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, an integer to add to the list and the position at which the integer must be inserted. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.

    A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.
    - [Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-a-specific-position-in-a-linked-list/problem)
    - [Solution](./insert-a-node-at-a-specific-position-in-a-linked-list/solution.js)
